            My first car was a 2007 Mazda 3 in manual. I had bought it six
            months after I passed my drivers test, and I didn’t even know how to
            drive stick yet. I took one lesson, and fell in love with the car,
            jumping into the process head first. Unfortunately, I was young and
            dumb so the car had issues(rod knock) that made it financially
            stupid to keep the car.

            I sold that car and then went to the dealer to get my 2014 Honda
            Civic! This thing became my baby. Drove great, sounded great,
            treated me great. It was perfect. I’ve always wanted to mod it but
            never had the funds. Now that I’ve moved back to the city, I had
            planned to get a job and finally start giving it the parts that it
            deserved. Unfortunately, plans change, and so she’s going to have to
            wait another few months, but in the mean time I’ve bought a few
            parts and have planned out what I’m buying next!

            My plan is to go full bolt on(FBO). This means I’ll be installing
            parts that are easy to install to gain more power, sound, or better
            feel. These are parts that even if I wanted to, I could install
            myself. I want my car to be as reliable as it has been to me over
            our time together. Eventually, when I have another car and I don’t
            drive this one as much, I would like to install a supercharger.
            Maximizing power for the car, but losing its renowned reliability.
